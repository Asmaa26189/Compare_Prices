This Project is useful for comparing prices in each market to find
the lowest price and fight rising prices.

Help people to get the best goods with the best prices.

Creating a comparison website for comparing prices can be a lucrative venture,
especially considering the increasing trend of online shopping.

Here's a proposal outline for such a website:

# Title: PriceCompare: Your Ultimate Price Comparison Destination

## Objective:
  PriceCompare aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to compare prices of various products across different online retailers,
  enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions and save money.

## Key Features:

  **Product Categories:** Organize products into various categories to make navigation easy for users.
                          Categories could include electronics, clothing, home appliances, etc.
                          
  **Search Functionality:** Implement a robust search feature that allows users to search for specific products by name, brand, category,
                            or any other relevant criteria.
                            
  **Price Comparison:** Aggregate prices of the same product from multiple online retailers and display them side by side,
                        highlighting the best deals and savings.
                        
  **User Reviews and Ratings:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products and retailers,
                                helping others make informed decisions based on real experiences.
                                
  **Price History:** Provide users with historical price data for products,
                    allowing them to track price fluctuations over time and decide on the best time to make a purchase.
                    
  **Deal Alerts:** Enable users to set up alerts for price drops or special deals on specific products,
                  ensuring they never miss out on savings.
                  
  **Mobile Compatibility:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices,
                            allowing users to compare prices on the go.
                            
  **Secure Transactions:** Partner with reputable online retailers and ensure secure transactions to build trust among users.

**Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing product and user data.

**Hosting:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure for reliable and scalable hosting solutions.

**Payment Gateway:** Integrate with secure payment gateways such as PayPal or Stripe for processing transactions.

## Challenge:

In a digital marketplace saturated with options, our challenge is to develop an innovative price comparison website that simplifies the shopping experience for consumers.

We seek to create a platform that seamlessly aggregates prices from diverse online retailers, providing users with comprehensive data and insightful analysis to facilitate informed decision-making. Our mission is to overcome the barriers of information overload and inconsistency in pricing, empowering users to find the best deals effortlessly.

Through cutting-edge technology and user-centric design, our goal is to revolutionize online shopping by offering a solution that is intuitive, reliable, and indispensable in the pursuit of savings and value.

## Risks:

**Data Accuracy and Integrity:** One of the primary risks is ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data sourced from various online retailers.

**Technical Challenges:** Developing a robust and scalable infrastructure to handle large volumes of data and concurrent user requests poses a technical challenge.

## Infrastructure:

**Main Repository:**
Create a main repository on GitHub named something like "PriceCompare" to host the project.

**Branches:**
Each one works in this project has its branch to avoid conflict and to be easy to compare.

## Existing Solutions:

**Google Shopping:**
Google Shopping allows users to compare prices across various online retailers for a wide range of products.

**Shopzilla:**
Shopzilla is a comprehensive shopping search engine that helps users find and compare prices for millions of products from thousands of online retailers.
